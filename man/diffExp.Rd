\usage{
diffExp(object, ...)

\S4method{diffExp}{SingleCellExperiment}(object, numerator, denominator,
  caller = c("edgeR", "DESeq2"), minCellsPerGene = 25L,
  minCountsPerCell = 5L)

\S4method{diffExp}{seurat}(object, numerator, denominator,
  caller = c("edgeR", "DESeq2"), minCellsPerGene = 25L,
  minCountsPerCell = 5L)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments.}

\item{numerator}{\code{character}. Cells to use in the numerator of the contrast
(e.g. treatment).}

\item{denominator}{\code{character}. Cells to use in the denominator of the
contrast (e.g. control).}

\item{caller}{\code{string}. Package to use for differential expression calling.
Defaults to \code{"edgeR"} (faster for large datasets) but \code{"DESeq2"} is also
supported.}

\item{minCellsPerGene}{\code{scalar integer}. The minimum number of cells where a
gene is expressed, to pass low expression filtering. Set to \code{0} to disable
(\emph{not recommended}).}

\item{minCountsPerCell}{\code{scalar integer}. Minimum number of counts per cell
for a gene to pass low expression filtering. The number of cells is defined
by \code{minCellsPerGene}. Set to \code{0} to disable (\emph{not recommended}).}
}
\value{
Varies depending on the \code{caller} argument:
\itemize{
\item \code{caller = "edgeR"}: \code{DEGLRT}.
\item \code{caller = "DESeq2"}: Unshrunken \code{DESeqResults}. Use \code{lfcShrink()} if
shrunken results are desired.
}

\description{
We are currently recommending the ZINB-WaVE method over zingeR, since it is
faster, and has been show to be more sensitive for most single-cell RNA-seq
datasets.

\section{zinbwave}{

We are currently using an epsilon setting of \code{1e12}, as recommended by the
ZINB-WaVE integration paper. For more information on the zinbwave package,
refer to these materials:

\section{edgeR}{

After estimation of the dispersions and posterior probabilities, the
\code{glmWeightedF()} function is used for statistical inference. This is an
adapted function from the \code{glmLRT()} function of edgeR. It uses an F-test for
which the denominator degrees of freedom are by default adjusted according to
the downweighting of excess zeros (\code{ZI = TRUE}). Also, independent filtering
can be performed on the obtained p-values (\code{independentFiltering = TRUE}). We
use the independent filtering strategy that was originally implemented in
DESeq2. By default, the average fitted values are used as a filter criterion.
}

\section{DESeq2}{

We're providing preliminary support for DESeq2 as the differential expression
caller. It is currently considerably slower for large datasets than edgeR.

We're trying to follow the conventions used in DESeq2 for contrasts, defining
the name of the factor in the design formula, numerator, and denominator
level for the fold change calculations. See \code{\link[DESeq2:results]{DESeq2::results()}} for more
information.
}

\section{Seurat conventions}{

Note that Seurat currently uses the convention \code{cells.1} for the numerator
and \code{cells.2} for the denominator. See \code{\link[Seurat:DiffExpTest]{Seurat::DiffExpTest()}} for
additional information.
