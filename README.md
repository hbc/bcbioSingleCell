[R][] package for [bcbio][] single-cell RNA-seq analysis.


## Installation

### [Bioconductor][] method

```r
## try http:// if https:// URLs are not supported
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("devtools")
biocLite("remotes")
biocLite("GenomeInfoDbData")
biocLite(
    "hbc/bcbioSingleCell",
    dependencies = c("Depends", "Imports", "Suggests")
)
```


## Load [bcbio][] run

```r
library(bcbioSingleCell)
bcb <- bcbioSingleCell(
    uploadDir = "bcbio_indrop/final",
    interestingGroups = c("genotype", "treatment"),
    sampleMetadataFile = "sample_metadata.csv",
    organism = "Homo sapiens",
    ensemblRelease = 90L
)
# Back up all data inside bcbioSingleCell object
flat <- flatFiles(bcb)
saveData(bcb, flat, dir = "data")
```

This will return a `bcbioSingleCell` object, which is an extension of the [Bioconductor][] [SingleCellExperiment][SCE] container class.

Parameters:

- `uploadDir`: Path to the [bcbio][] final upload directory.
- `interestingGroups`: Character vector of the column names of interest in the sample metadata, which is stored in the `sampleData()` accessor slot of the `bcbioSingleCell` object. These values should be formatted in camelCase, and can be reassigned in the object after creation (e.g. `interestingGroups(bcb) <- c("batch", "age")`). They are used for data visualization in the quality control utility functions.
- `organism`: Organism name. Use the full latin name (e.g. "Homo sapiens"). If set `NULL`, no gene annotations will be downloaded and stashed into the `rowRanges` slot of the object.
- `genomeBuild`: *Optional.* The Ensembl release version to use.
- `gffFile`: *Optional.* If your transcriptome does not entirely match up to an Ensembl release, you can pass the GFF/GTF file of the transcriptome you used to load the annotations instead.

Consult `help("bcbioSingleCell", "bcbioSingleCell")` for additional documentation.


## Sample metadata examples

### FASTQ files with samples multiplexed by index barcode

This is our current recommended method for analyzing an [inDrops][] dataset. The sample index barcodes are multiplexed per FASTQ set. For Illumina sequencing data, the raw binary base call (BCL) data must be converted into FASTQs (split into `R1`-`R4` files) using [bcl2fastq][].

The [inDrops][] library version is automatically detected by [bcbio][], but ensure that the sample index sequences provided match the library version when attempting to create a `bcbioSingleCell` object. A current list of [inDrops v3 index barcodes](https://github.com/seqcloud/seqcloud/blob/master/workflows/bcbio/scrnaseq/harvard_indrop_v3/index_barcodes.csv) is available from [seqcloud][].

Consult the [bcbio][] documentation for more information on how to configure an [inDrops][] run prior to loading into [R][] with the `bcbioSingleCell()` function.

| description | index | sequence | sampleName |
|-------------|-------|----------|------------|
| indrops1    | 17    | GGAGGTAA | sample1    |
| indrops1    | 18    | CATAACTG | sample2    |
| indrops2    | 12    | GCGTAAGA | sample3    |
| indrops2    | 13    | CTATTAAG | sample4    |
| indrops2    | 14    | AAGGCTAT | sample5    |
| indrops2    | 15    | GAGCCTTA | sample6    |
| indrops2    | 16    | TTATGCGA | sample7    |

### FASTQ files demultiplexed per sample

This is our current method for handling [10X Genomics Cell Ranger][cellranger] output (using `readCellRanger()`) and [Illumina SureCell][surecell] sample data.

| description | genotype |
|-------------|----------|
| sample1     | wildtype |
| sample2     | knockout |
| sample3     | wildtype |
| sample4     | knockout |

### Forbidden metadata fields
The following fields are forbidden as user-supplied metadata, as they are used
internally:

`nCells`

## Troubleshooting

### Maximal number of DLLs reached

```
Error: package or namespace load failed for 'bcbioSingleCell' in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):
  maximal number of DLLs reached...
```

Depending on your operating system, you may encounter this error about hitting the DLL limit in [R][]. This issue is becoming more common as RNA-seq analysis packages grow increasingly complex. Luckily, we can configure [R][] to increase the DLL limit. Append this line to your `~/.Renviron` file:

```
R_MAX_NUM_DLLS=150
```

For more information on this issue, consult `help("dyn.load")` in the [R][] documentation. The number of loaded DLLs in an [R][] session can be obtained with `getLoadedDLLs()`.
