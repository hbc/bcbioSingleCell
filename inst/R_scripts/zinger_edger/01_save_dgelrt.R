# zingeR-edgeR
#
# We first perform a differential expression analysis using zingeR posterior
# probabilities and focussing on the count component of the ZINB model. We use
# edgeR to model the count component.
#
# The weights are estimated with the core function of zingeR, `zeroWeightsLS()`.
# It is important to be consistent with the normalization procedure, i.e. if you
# use TMM normalization for the analysis, you should also use it for estimating
# the zingeR posterior probabilities. The weights can then be provided in the
# DGEList object which will be used for dispersion estimation in the native
# edgeR `estimateDisp()` function.
#
# After estimation of the dispersions and zingeR posterior probabilities, the
# `glmWeightedF()` function is used for statistical inference. This is an
# adapted function from the `glmLRT()` function of edgeR. It uses an F-test for
# which the denominator degrees of freedom are by default adjusted according to
# the downweighting of excess zeros (`ZI = TRUE`). Also, independent filtering
# can be performed on the obtained p-values (`independentFiltering = TRUE`). We
# use the independent filtering strategy that was originally implemented in
# DESeq2. By default, the average fitted values are used as a filter criterion.
